The task requirements:



React components display all users and comments data (separated tables) from two different endpoints in a tabular form.



Use the public API to get data:

Comments: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments

Users: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

The solution should be done in TypeScript at a high level of abstraction. We want to see your way of thinking, how you organize your components and how you incorporate best practices into your code.



Rather than relying on UI libraries, we would prefer it if you created your own custom components. You are free to use any other libraries for data fetching, caching, state management, or anything that is needed to complete the task.

Finally, the data should be presented in a user-friendly way, so some sort of pagination is very welcome.
